# Valid Palindrome

## Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

## Constraints
- 1 <= s.length <= 2 * 10^5
- The string consists of printable ASCII characters.

## Approaches

### Brute Force Approach
- **Algorithm**: Clean the string and check if it equals its reverse.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
- **Pros**: Simple to implement.
- **Cons**: Uses additional space.

### Two Pointer Approach
- **Algorithm**: Use two pointers to compare characters from start and end.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- **Pros**: In-place comparison, efficient.
- **Cons**: None significant.

## Edge Cases
- Empty string or single character, always a palindrome.
- Strings with only non-alphanumeric characters.

## Learning Points
- Understanding of string manipulation and character handling.
- Efficient use of two pointers for in-place operations.

## Common Mistakes
- Forgetting to handle non-alphanumeric characters.
- Not considering case insensitivity.

## Interview Tips
- Discuss both approaches and their trade-offs.
- Explain the benefits of in-place operations.
