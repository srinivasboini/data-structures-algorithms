# Valid Palindrome II

## Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, return true if the `s` can be palindrome after deleting at most one character from it.

## Constraints
- 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Approaches

### Brute Force Approach
- **Algorithm**: Try removing each character and check if the resulting string is a palindrome.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
- **Pros**: Simple to understand.
- **Cons**: Inefficient for large strings.

### Two Pointer Approach
- **Algorithm**: Use two pointers to check for palindrome, allowing one character removal.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- **Pros**: Efficient and straightforward.
- **Cons**: None significant.

### Recursive Approach
- **Algorithm**: Use recursion to check for palindrome with one allowed removal.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
- **Pros**: Elegant recursive solution.
- **Cons**: Higher space usage due to recursion stack.

## Edge Cases
- Already a palindrome, return true.
- Single character, return true.

## Learning Points
- Understanding of two pointers and recursion.
- Efficient handling of constraints in string problems.

## Common Mistakes
- Not handling the case where no deletions are needed.
- Incorrectly managing indices during recursion.

## Interview Tips
- Discuss all approaches and their trade-offs.
- Explain the benefits of using two pointers for in-place operations.
