/**
 * Optimal implementation using center expansion technique to find the longest palindromic substring.
 * 
 * Approach:
 * 1. Iterate over each possible center in the string. Each character can be the center of an odd-length
 *    palindrome, and each pair of adjacent characters is the center of an even-length palindrome.
 * 2. Expand around each center as long as the characters on both sides match.
 * 3. Keep track of the current longest palindrome (by its starting and ending indices).
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) - For each character, we potentially expand in both directions.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Only a few integer variables are used.
